Blog website
This project is a full-stack blog website created using Cursor IDE with the specific purpose of exploring its strengths and identifying its limitations. The goal was not only to build a functioning blog platform but also to demonstrate scenarios where relying solely on an agentic IDE is not enough, highlighting the importance of combining it with additional tools, frameworks, and manual refinement.

The blog platform provides a secure user authentication system that allows individuals to register, log in, and manage their accounts. Only logged-in users are permitted to create blog posts, ensuring controlled content contribution. Each user has full ownership of their content, meaning they can edit or delete only the posts they authored. At the same time, an admin role exists with the elevated privilege to edit or remove any post across the platform. This dual system balances personal control with administrative oversight.

To make the blogging experience more personal, users can upload and manage their profile picture directly through the website. The platform ensures that all posts displayed on the main homepage include essential metadata such as the author’s profile image, date and time of publishing, blog title, and post content. Additionally, each user has a dedicated profile page showcasing all the blogs they have created, offering an easy way to navigate user-specific content.

For a more engaging experience, the system introduces customizable themes. A logged-in user can select a preferred theme, and the choice is preserved for subsequent sessions, ensuring a consistent, personalized interface whenever they log back in.

The development process using Cursor revealed areas where the IDE is extremely helpful, such as rapid prototyping, generating boilerplate code, and simplifying repetitive tasks. However, it also highlighted limitations in handling advanced integrations, fine-grained debugging, and larger system design decisions—showing why traditional development knowledge and external tools remain essential.

In short, this project is both a functional blog system and a case study on the evolving capabilities of agentic IDEs, demonstrating what they can accomplish independently and where they still require human developers to step in.
